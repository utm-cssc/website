        The Computer Science Student Community (CSSC) is a community
        organization overseen by the Computer Science Faculty in MCS. Taking its
        roots from the Hacklab, the CSSC is tasked to support studentsâ€™ academic
        and professional needs throughout their university career all while
        providing space and opportunity for community growth. The CSSC also acts
        as a central hub for computer science students to seek guidance, advice,
        and support. Furthermore, they act as a supporting pillar between all
        MCS student clubs/societies.
