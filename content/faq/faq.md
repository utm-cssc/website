When are the maximum cut-offs for POSt going to be posted? | As of right now, we
are not sure when the maximums will be set due to multiple factors (e.g. COVID,
new administration, etc.) The official cut-offs themselves are projected to be
set in later May 2020. (Nov. 2020) Will there be a huge increase in POSt
requirements this year? | The department is unsure since there seems to be a
decrease in student enrollment this year coupled with other factors. Though,
they suspect it won't go up by a lot. How many first year courses are we allowed
to take? | Prior to September 2020, 6.0 credits for 100-level courses would
count towards your degree. But currently, you can check how many 100-level
courses count towards your degree and other specifications through the Degree
Explorer tool accessible through ACORN under "Academics" > "Planning Tools". I
don't know where to start with personal/side projects. | Check out our Resource
page at the top of the screen! When is reading week? | Winter 2021: February
16th, 2021 - February 19th, 2021.
