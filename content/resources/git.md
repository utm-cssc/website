## What Is Git?

Git is a version control system for keeping track of changes in any set of files
and was originally designed for collaborative work among progammers.

It is widely used by developers to track revisions in applications, store
modifications, and make constant updates to your applications to release new
versions with ease.

## What Is Version Control?

Version control is a practice for tracking and managing changes to applications.
It enables developers to simultaneously work on a single application in which
each developer edits their own copy of the files and chooses when to release
their changes to the rest of the team.

Version control is specifically useful for branching and merging different
instances of the application to allow an asynchronous workflow.
