# CSS

## Motivation
CSS is an integral part of the modern web development process. It is a highly effective HTML tool that provides easy control over layout and presentation of website pages by separating content from design.

CSS gives us the opportunity to play with a page layout, adjust colors and fonts, add effects to images, etc.

## What is CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## Sass
Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet. Sass is an extension to CSS. Sass is a CSS pre-processor. Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.
