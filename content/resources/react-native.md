# React Native

## What is React Native?

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering
mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s
JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the
browser, it targets mobile platforms.

In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and
feel truly “native”, all with the comfort of a JavaScript library that we
already know and love. Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared
between platforms, React Native makes it easy to develop for both Android and
iOS simultaneously.
