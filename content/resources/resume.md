## Getting the Right Experience

the Coding Interview_

### Take the big project classes

If you worked hard and did well in a non-trivial project for a 200+ level
Computer Science course here at UTM, you likely gained expertise that you can
talk about in your resume.

Be prepared to answer technical questions related to these projects during the
interview. Sounds fair :)

school projects on a resume_

Please do not publicly upload your assignment code to Github. Your assignment
code may be copied, which would result in an academic offense for both parties.

### Get an internship

_"I need experience to get experience"_ **is real**

Check out where you can apply [here](/resources/internship-apps)

Build your professional network to leverage personal recommendations when
looking for jobs. Join our
[LinkedIn Community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8798043/) to connect with
UTM students in the industry.

### Start something

Starting self-initiated projects are an excellent way to acquire the skills that
go into building and maintaining real world systems.

The university workload doesn't make this easy, since these projects require
time and effort to realize, but we encourage students to persevere and pursue
this path.

## Google's Guidance

**Your resume is the first piece of information employers see about you. Here’s
how to highlight your achievements:**

- Align your skills and experience with the internship or job description

- Be specific about projects you’ve worked on or managed. What was the outcome?
  How did you measure success?

- If you've had a leadership role in a volunteer organization or at a part-time
  job, tell us about it. How big was the team? What was the scope of your work?

- Include your GPA, as well as school-related projects or coursework that
  demonstrate relevant skills and knowledge **as you see fit**

- Keep it short: Aim for one page. If there’s additional information we need
  during the hiring process, (like a portfolio), your recruiter will work with
  you to collect it
