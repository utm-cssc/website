However, when users enter your site, you want to be able to update and change your site as the user interacts with it. For example, you may have an HTML button, but you may want to change the color of the site on the click of that button. How do we accomplish that? The answer, Javascript!"></grid-1-x-2>

It is used to create, update and delete the Elements in your HTML pages based on user interaction. It can be used as a scripted function-based language as well as a prototype-based object oriented language. Take a look at the JavaScript tutorial on W3 schools to start learning!"></grid-1-x-2>

### JavaScript Frontend Frameworks

Managing indvidual HTML, CSS and JavaScript files can become very difficult to
handle once your site gets very large. In order to solve this problem, we use
"JavaScript Frameworks" for frontend development. It allows you to write HTML,
CSS and JavaScript in a standardized, consistent and organized way to maxmize
scalability. This site for instance is built on a framework called "NuxtJS".
Here are some JavaScript frameworks you can look into, some of which have
resource pages on this site:

- [ReactJS]
- [VueJS]
- [AngularJS]
- [NuxtJS]

### NodeJS

However, in order to facilitate full-stack development in a single language, a server-side JavaScript framework called NodeJS was introduced to allow web application backends to be written in JavaScript. It is typically used to create REST APIs which are called by the application's frontend. Checkout this Node.JS tutorial from morioh!"></grid-1-x-2>
