# Figma

## What is Figma?

Figma is a primarily web-based tool used to seamlessly design and prototype user
interfaces. Created by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, from the beginning Figma's
intentions were to allow for an ease of creative expression and collaboration
through the website's many tools and features.

Designers commonly use Figma to create wireframes or user interfaces that would
be later realized as a final product by the developers of a team. With an
emphasis on collaboration and critiques, Figma allows its users to easily
prototype and share their designs through features such as team libraries.
