# Introduction

## What is REST?

Representational state transfer, also known as REST, is a software architectural
style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. By
using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations, it allows any system
to request and access the web resources.

## Why use REST

REST allows web services to have faster performance, reliability and ease of
access. This is all achieved by using a stateless protocol and standard
operations.

The API also enables systems to easily communicate with each other, as long as
they are connected to the web. This can include: 2 different computer systems
communicating with each other, or a system communicating and retrieving data
from a database

One of the most important uses of REST is that it allows the use of
microservice, which is a very important concept as we start working with larger
web services.

# Learning REST

## How it works

The REST API is mainly composed of requests which is a way for the web service
to communicate with the servers or other web services. Once a request has been
initialized by the web service, the request is then sent to the server, which
will then act accordingly to the request method that was sent. Once the server
has finished the request, it will then return a service code and a response body
if needed.

A regular REST request will consist of four things: the endpoint, the method,
the headers, and the data.

- The endpoint is the URL you are requesting for.
- The method is the action you wish the server to act upon, the commonly used
  methods are the HTTP methods.
- The headers are used to provide information to both the client and the server.
- The data is the request body, and it contains the information you wish to send
  to the server

Commonly used HTTP methods are:

- POST: Creates a new resource at the end point.

- GET: Retrieves a representation of the data in the response body.

- PUT: Updates known resources with the new data from the request body. If the
  resource does not exist, it will create a resource with the data from the
  request body.

- PATCH: Modifies a known resource with a set of instructions.

- DELETE: Deletes a known resource.
