# MAT102: Intro to Mathematical Proofs

#### Prerequisite: None

<ExamText class-code="MAT102"></ExamText>

### What is it about?

Welcome to your first proof-based mathematics course at UofT!

What is a proof?

- A proof, mathematical or not, is an argument or explanation that shows that
  something is absolutely, unequivocally true, beyond any shadow of a doubt.
  When you have accomplished that, it feels like magic.

- The satisfaction when you write down Q.E.D.

### Overview

Written by: Akira Takaki

For students coming from Ontario highschools, MAT102 is pretty difficult to wrap
your head around. This is your first exposure to non-computational maths, where
you use theorems and logic to prove things!

You need to understand that this is the CSC108 of math. It’s very different from
actual math courses just like programming is not computer science. Here are
MAT102-specific tips.

Be aware of the nit-picky stuff. just like in CSC108, there’s a lot of nit-picky
details that us 102 TAs want you to state. Proofs are just arguments in math,
and you should justify (with English!) how what you did is true, because it
follows from other true things.

- Stay on the ball. There’s usually a 10% quiz within one or two weeks of the
  class starting, and it’s going to hit you — hard. If it doesn’t, maybe math is
  your thing? Either way, you want to make sure you know your deadlines and
  don’t fall behind, because this course has a ton of deadlines.

- Practice, a lot. You need to start practicing every day, early on, by doing
  practice problems. MAT102 has a decent amount of computational practice that
  you need to get down pat.

- Start early! If something comes out, you need to look at it as early as
  possible. You can’t cram this course, and you need to really start asking
  questions early. Problem sets are a marathon, never a sprint.

- If you end up liking this course, consider taking MAT240 (linear algebra for
  proofs), which is offered only in the winter. It’s a really fun continuation
  of some of the concepts you’ve now learnt, and is less pedantic.
