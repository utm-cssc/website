# PEY

Written by: Jarrod Servilla

## What Is PEY?

PEY (Professional Experience Year) is an optional, 12–16 month co-op program
that students at all of the University of Toronto’s campus can do after their
second year of studies. Generally, most students do so after third year as most
co-op positions are looking for third year students. It is focused towards those
in CS and Engineering, however there are some positions available for Business
and Accounting students. (Check out /u/CTJEJK ‘s experiences as a non-CS/ENG
student getting a data science PEY over
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/efmbe2/personal_tips_and_info_about_pey/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Some companies in the PEY portal include: Oracle, Red Hat, AMD, IBM, Intel,
Huawei, Kijiji, RBC, TD, Manulife, CIBC, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan,
Environment and Climate Change Canada, ExxonMobil, Loblaws.

International students need to provide a co-op work permit and social insurance
number before beginning their PEY work term. As of Jan 2022, international
students at UTM can do PEY if they are in the CS major or specialist programs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How do I do it?

You’ll register over
<a href="https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/welcome.asp" target="_blank">here</a>,
and you can register in either the fall or winter term. There is no difference
between the two, so I advise you to register for the fall one as you’ll be able
to see more positions!

2. Is there a minimum GPA?

According to this link, you just need to be in good academic standing which is >
1.50.

3. What is my student status during PEY?

While you work full-time as a PEY Co-op student, you will retain full-time
student status at the University of Toronto.

4. Will I need to pay incidental fees while I’m working at my PEY Co-op
   position?

Students pay part-time incidental fees for each of the fall and winter terms
while on PEY Co-op, which ensures you have access to important University
services and plans.

5. If I receive OSAP, will I retain my interest-free status while I’m on PEY
   Co-op? Do I need to let OSAP know that I’m still a student while on PEY
   Co-op?

Yes. To retain your interest-free status, you will need to complete the
Continuation of Interest-Free Status (CIFS) form online through OSAP. It is
recommended that you complete the CIFS application as early as possible.

6. Do I get a credit?

Well yes, but actually no. It will appear on your transcript as “PEY Co-op 500”
credit/no-credit course, but not contribute anything meaningful such as being
able to take less courses. For engineers, it will count towards their work hours
completion requirement.

7. Can I take courses during PEY?

Yes, with some limitations.

- Check that the course is not core/mandatory for your POSt and is not scheduled
  during work hours
- Speak with your manager about taking the course, ensure your work will not be
  affected
- Complete the PEY course approval form
- Submit request along w/ completed form to pey.coop@utoronto.ca

8. Can I get a PEY job with a bad gpa/as a CS minor?

Yes! A lot of people I know have gotten great co-op experiences as a CS minor,
or with a bad GPA, or both. If you’re in this situation, try to work on side
projects/hackathons outside of school to make your resume stand out and practice
leetcode.

9. Should I do 12 months or 16 months?

In my opinion, 12 months starting in May. You’ll be able to leverage your
experience into a 4-month internship, or if you like it where you are you could
extend the co-op by talking to your manager. /u/TuloCantHitski made a great post
over
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/efybz4/why_you_should_break_up_your_pey/" target="_blank">here</a>,
please check it out.

10. What is a good hourly pay?

This really depends on your skillset and experience, but I’d say you should try
to find a salary >= the current median of \$55 000.

11. Can I negotiate pay?

Of course, if you think you’re not being compensated fairly due to your
experience (past internships, side projects, TAships, hackathons), then you can
try to negotiate for a higher pay. Just write a polite email explaining the
circumstances. According to the PEY office, the company cannot revoke the offer
due to negotiation unless you were inappropriate in your email.

NOTE: Some companies do not budge at all. According to the PEY office, AMD and
Intel have strictly set pay guidelines.

## The Application Process

You will need a resume, cover letter, and your unofficial transcript (Acorn ->
Academic History -> Complete Academic History -> Download as PDF).

### Resume

This is not the end-all-be-all format, feel free to tweak it to your preference.
If you have a CS internship, then work experience should be above projects.
Otherwise, put it under.

General format:

- Information (Name, phone number, email, github, linkedin)
- Education (Program, GPA, start date to expected graduation date, relevant
  coursework, scholarships/awards)
- Skills (Programming languages, tools)
- Work Experience (Job title, place of employment, length of employment, job
  desc points, technologies used if applicable)
- Projects (Project title, technologies used, project description, github link)

NOTE: Be careful about uploading CS assignments on Github. It is possible you
will be flagged for AO.

- Campus involvement (if applicable)

General tips:

- Should be one-page, concise
- Descriptions should be in active voice, results oriented, such as:
  > Optimized SQL queries that resulted in an efficiency increase rate of 300%
- LOOK OVER YOUR RESUME CAREFULLY. Anything on there can be questioned! If you
  have anything that you don’t know too well, TAKE IT OFF! If you get questioned
  and you don’t know it well enough, the interview might be instantly donezo for
  you.
- Think about what your resume says about you. For example, if you have a good
  amount of mobile and web applications, you can be asked why you wanted to work
  specifically in certain areas like C software development and backend.

### Cover Letters

General format:

- Introduction
- Description of past work (place of employment, job title, description of
  duties, what you learned)

**If you are not getting any interviews, there is a problem with your resume or
cover letter.**

## The Interview

Congrats, you got an interview! If it’s an on-site, you’ll receive an email
notification, and you’ll have to go to the PEY job portal site -> Interviews ->
Click the interview for the job -> Sign up for a time slot

Interviews will normally be hosted at the Engineering Career Centre (Fields
Institute, enter make a right then a left and it’ll be on your right), however
they can be hosted elsewhere.

The interview process for various jobs differs, which could be up to 3 or 4
rounds. Some jobs are entirely onsite, half onsite half online, or entirely
online. Some things you may have to do:

- HR Phone Call — They’ll just ask you questions that you normally fill out on
  the job application and whatnot.
- Online Coding Assessment — 2 or 3 leetcode easy/medium questions completed on
  an online assessment site.
- Phone/Video Interview — Same format as a normal interview, but you might have
  to write out code on a code sharing platform.

For onsite interviews:

- Make sure you bring a copy of your resume! They will go over your resume with
  you, so it’s good to have this on hand to review.
- Research the company and job position.
- You should be dressed semi-formal, this applies even for online interviews.
- Always be courteous to anyone you talk to, such as the receptionist.
- Be attentive during the interview! Make eye contact and don’t be rude or
  condescending.
- There’s free snacks + juice at the ECC, so if you’re nervous try to grab a
  bite and take deep breaths.

Interviews usually consist of:

- Introduction from interviews and a description of what the job entails
- Ask you why you want to work there/for that specific position and what you
  know about their company
- Overview of your resume, asking questions about previous work experience and
  projects
- Soft skills questions: what would you do in X situation, name a time when Y
  happened and how did you react.
- 1 or 2 technical questions done on the whiteboard
- Opportunity for you to ask questions

Here are examples of questions you might get:

Previous Experience:

- Why did you choose to use [technology X]?
- What project were you most proud of during your time at [workplace]?
- What were some things that you learnt while working at [workplace]?

Soft Skills:

- Why do you wanna work for [company]?
- Give a time when you had an internal conflict in your team, and how did you
  resolve it?
- What should you do if you have a disagreement with your manager?
- Tell us a time when you had to work under a lot of pressure, and how you
  handled it.
- What is your greatest strength? What is your greatest weakness?

## Technicals

**The most important part of answering technical questions is describing your
thought process.** While correctness does play a part, being able to articulate
as you go along will matter a lot and can tell the employer how effective you’d
be in a team. String questions are pretty popular in interviews, such as find
the smallest word in a string, and then calculate its efficiency.

I try to do the following:

1. Write out some test cases! This is a good time to make sure you understand
   the problem correctly with the interviewer.
2. Come up with a solution asap, no matter how ugly. Can you think of a O(n^2)
   solution? That’s OK! Once again, this is a good way to confirm that you’re on
   the right track and can try to optimize it.
3. Refine your answer so that it is the optimal solution. Alright — this one
   just takes practice, but my general procedure is to draw out the problem, see
   if any data structures are applicable, and think of if I’ve done something
   similar in leetcode/class before.
4. Discuss time & space complexity.

## What to Ask

Lastly, the recruiter will ask you if you have any questions. Always have some
on hand, since interviews are a two-way street. You wanna know whether you would
like to there or not as much as they want to see if you’re a good candidate.

Here’s some questions that I ask the interviewers.

- How do you define success in this role?
- What do you do in a normal day?
- To what extent is testing or CI/CD involved in the deployment process?
