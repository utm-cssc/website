[MindOrks](https://mindorks.com/) has published an excellent Android Developer
Roadmap that you can find
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MindorksOpenSource/android-developer-roadmap/master/images/android_developer_roadmap.png)

## Android Jetpack

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and architectural guidance that
make it quick and easy to build great Android apps.

Components are individually adoptable but built to work together while taking
advantage of Kotlin language features that make you more productive.

Jetpack manages tedious activities like background tasks, navigation, and
lifecycle management, so you can eliminate boilerplate code and focus on what
makes your app great.
