# React

## What is React

React (also known as ReactJS or React.js) is an open-source declarative,
efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React
was developed by Facebook and first deployed in the Facebook news feed in 2011.

React.js lets you compose complex UIs from small, isolated and resuable pieces
of code called "components". In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are
the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else
someone interacts with to use a website or app.

## Why React?

In addition to providing reusable React library code (saving development time
and cutting down on the chance for coding errors), React comes with two key
features that add to its appeal for JavaScript developers:

- JSX
- Virtual DOM

### JSX

JSX (short for JavaScript eXtension) is a React extension that makes it easy for
web developers to modify their DOM by using simple, HTML-style code. And—since
React JS browser support extends to all modern web browsers—JSX is compatible
with any browser platform you might be working with.

### Virtual DOM

React.js creates a Virtual DOM which is the copy of site's DOM. React uses this
copy to see what parts of the actual DOM is changed when an event happens (like
a user clicking a button) and selectively updates the DOM only.
