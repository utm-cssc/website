# Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is a virtualization platform used to create and deploy applications by
using containers.

It is widely used in the industry as it provides developers an easy way of
packaging and effortlessly deploying their applications on many systems!

Docker accelerates a developer's workflow while providing the flexibility with
using their choice of tools, deployment variables and much more!

## What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that can be easily
run from one computer to the next.

Inside a container, it contains all of the necessary libraries and dependencies
required.

Containers make use of a shared underlying OS kernel to run their applications
as opposed to traditionally running multiple VMs each with their own individual
OS.
