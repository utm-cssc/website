## What is CSC148?

CSC148 is an Introduction to Computer Science course. This course teaches you
basic data structures (e.g. Stack, Queues, etc.) and powerful concepts like
Object Oriented Programming and Recursion.

## Overview

Written by: Naaz Sibia

CSC148 assumes you have knowledge from CSC108, but the concepts taught here are
going to be quite different from CSC108. While CSC108 is a “programming” focused
course, CSC148 is an introduction to computer science, so there is more focus on
the concepts you learn in class. What this can mean: don’t worry too much if
your CSC108 mark isn’t great! While CSC148 requires CSC108 knowledge, the
concepts are quite different. So even if your CSC108 mark isn’t great, there is
still a chance that you can get a good mark in CSC148.

CSC148 starts off by building on the OOP concepts that CSC108 usually ends with.
After learning OOP principles, and designing classes, the course switches to
talking about abstract data types (stacks, queues, linked lists).

After about 6 weeks — you’ll start learning about recursion, which is what the
course is mainly infamous for. A lot of students dread this, but you don’t need
to! The instructors usually teach recursion slowly, and provide lots of
examples. They assume you don’t know recursion, so you can trust the teaching
process, and make sure you practice a lot.

The course has 2–3 assignments and weekly readings + prep exercises that you
complete before class. The first assignment is about OOP principles, and the
second assignment is usually about recursion and trees.

Like CSC108 — code assignments are marked based on correctness and style. For
the OOP assignment, there is also manual marking to check if you used OOP
principles correctly.

Lecture Prep: CSC148 at UTM usually doesn’t use PCRS. However, the course has
readings and prep exercises that students usually need to complete before
lecture. The prep exercises include a code writing exercise that is automarked
on markus, and a Quercus multiple choice quiz which has infinite attempts. The
class typically follows an ALC format, so you will be reviewing the prep briefly
and working on new questions in lecture.
