# CSC263: Data Structures and Analysis

#### Prerequisite: [CSC207](./csc207), [CSC236](./csc236), [STA256](./sta256)

<ExamText class-code="CSC263"></ExamText>

### What is CSC263?

CSC263 is a course that focuses on the different types of data structures, from
binary search trees to graphs, and how they affect the time complexity. Students
will also learn more techniques on finding and proving time complexity for
different variants of algorithms.

After this course, students will be able to tackle any interview questions
relating to data structures and time complexities.

### Topics in CSC263:

- Time complexity
- Priority Queues: Heaps
- Dictionaries
- Trees: Binary, Balanced, Augmentated, Minimum Spanning
- Hashing
- Amortised Analysis
- Quicksort
- Graphs and Graph Traversals
- Disjoint Sets
- Randomised Algorithms
