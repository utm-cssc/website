## Why Github?

Github has many advantages, such as the ability to create repositories, a
location where all files for a project are stored, as well as the ability to
fork a repository. This allows other developers to create new projects based off
existing projects.

Github is also not only used for developers to create and host projects, but it
is also used for social networking. It allows developers to create a portfolio
showcasing their projects to potential employers.
